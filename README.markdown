CastMe
======

Podcasts are the best things in the world. Sometimes I get hold of radio shows, lectures, etc. which don't belong to their own RSS feed / podcast. I then promptly forget about them because it's a pain to load them into iTunes and give them the correct settings, etc.

This little Sinatra app will take a bunch of mp3 files and create an RSS feed for you to load them all into iTunes.

Usage
-----

1. Copy over the mp3 files you want to podcast into public/shows.
2. Host the app using your webserver of choice.
3. Add the url of your webserver in iTunes => Advanced => Subscribe to podcast.
